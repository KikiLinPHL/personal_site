# Kiki's Personal Website

Used React Library and SCSS

# Context

I initially had another repository for my personal website that I had been updating but after making my changes, the github's pages was not cooperating with getting the site up and running smoothly. I made another repository (this one) and it was able to display everything as it was coded!

I will be continuing to update this site as it is, as of May 15, 2022, not complete!
